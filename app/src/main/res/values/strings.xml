        Home - Here show for you the last three song that was played.
        For the screen I used just TextViews to compose, and the selected menu is standard for others activities too.
        The menu below was created using TextView using "android:drawableTop" to set images.
        I connected them using intents inside the setOnClickListener method, the behavior is, when the user click, specified intent is called.
